# Assets

This directory contains static assets used throughout the application.

## Structure

- Organize assets by type
- Use meaningful and consistent naming
- Optimize images before adding them
- Include proper attribution files if required

Example structure:
```
assets/
  ├── images/          # Photos and graphics
  ├── icons/           # SVG and icon files
  ├── fonts/           # Custom font files
  └── videos/          # Video content
```

Best practices:
- Use appropriate file formats (SVG for icons, WebP for images)
- Keep file sizes optimized
- Follow a clear naming convention
- Include source files for modified assets when applicable
