# Components

This directory contains reusable React components that can be used throughout the application.

## Structure

- Place each component in its own directory
- Include any component-specific styles or utilities in the component's directory
- Use PascalCase for component names and directories

Example structure:
```
components/
  └── Button/
      ├── Button.jsx
      ├── Button.module.css
      └── index.js
```
